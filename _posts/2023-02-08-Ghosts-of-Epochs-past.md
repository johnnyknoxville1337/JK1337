## Secureum Races and the Importance of Auditing Skills   
When discussing blockchain technology, the concept of smart contracts is often brought up. Smart contracts are pieces of code that can be deployed on a blockchain network and are designed to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.  
The most popular language for creating smart contracts is Solidity.  

Solidity is a programming language used to create decentralized applications (Dapps) and smart contracts. It was designed to be similar to JavaScript and is used for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is the platform on which Ethereum Dapps are interacting with.  
Solidity (should) enable programmers create complex and secure applications on the blockchain.  

However, Solidity is also prone to security flaws. This is especially true when it comes to the development of Solidity-based applications and smart contracts.
One of the ways this risk can be mitigated is through [secureum races](https://secureum.substack.com/) and the use of highly experienced auditors and their code review skills.  

Secureum races are competitions where developers are challenged to review the most advanced piece of code. These competitions are used to test the identification skills in finding security flaws smart contracts. The code and the questions created for these races is reviewed by a panel of experts, who identify any potential security issues, leave them in the code or the business logic to prove the participants ability in finding the flaws while getting points for right answers.

Building up experienced auditors which have the knowledge and experience to identify potential security flaws in solidity code is crucial for the whole ecosystem. Their job is to help developers create secure code by providing feedback on their code and suggesting ways to improve its security. Auditors can also provide guidance on best practices for coding and security to ensure that applications and smart contracts are as secure as possible.  

In conclusion, Solidity security is a critical component of the blockchain space. Secureum races and the use of auditing skills can be effective tools for ensuring that Solidity-based applications and smart contracts are as secure as possible. It is important for developers to take the necessary steps to ensure their code is secure and that any potential security flaws are identified and addressed.  

Auditing skills go beyond identifying potential security issues. Auditors can provide guidance on best practices and suggest ways to improve code security. They can also help developers understand the security implications of the code they are writing. Additionally, auditors can help developers understand the potential risks associated with the use of Solidity and other blockchain technologies.  

Finally, developers should always keep in mind that security is an ongoing process and should be monitored and updated on a regular basis.

By utilizing secureum races and properly utilizing auditing skills, developers can ensure the security of their Solidity applications and smart contracts. Regular audits by experienced auditors can help identify and address any potential security issues and ensure that the code being written is secure. Additionally, developers should be aware of the potential risks associated with the use of Solidity and other blockchain technologies, and should always strive to keep their code up to date and secure.  

In conclusion, the security of Solidity-based applications and smart contracts is paramount. Utilizing secureum races and auditing skills can help ensure their security and reliability. Additionally, developers should be aware of the potential risks associated with the use of Solidity and other blockchain technologies, and should strive to keep their code up to date and secure.

## potential steps moving forward with security auditing  
[ ] Participate in secureum races to identify potential security flaws in smart contracts,  
    which can lead to costly consequences if not detected and addressed quickly.  
[ ] Interact with experienced auditors on Discord and Twitter to review code and suggest ways  
    to improve security, such as using secure library functions.  
[ ] Understand the security implications of the code being written, including the potential for malicious actors  
    to exploit vulnerabilities and the potential risks associated.  
[ ] Define your Monitoring and Incident Response Strategy to create visibility and actionable insights while testing changes  
    against a suite of automated tests and conducting periodic manual reviews to detect any newly introduced or existing vulnerabilities.  
[ ] Establish a secure coding practice by following industry best practices and security standards.  
[ ] Utilize automated static code analysis tools to detect potential security issues.  
[ ] Get familiar with the concepts of formal verification and assess the tools applicable for it.
